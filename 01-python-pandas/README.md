# Week 1 Learning Python Library Pandas

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
Understanding how Pandas works in Python and how to use it with Data. So far I've learned how to actually index through a dataframe and how to use 'Summary Functions' as well as mapping data to the dataframe so I can extract the data I want.

As a little activity to test my knowledge, I took my youtube music history and analyzed some of the songs that came up the most and least, as well as what times I most commonly listen to music. So far I've learned that:
- I'm quite the fan of Future, and I love Burna Boy's 'On The Low'
- I most commonly listen to music around 

## ðŸ“š Topics Learned
- DataFrames and Series
- Indexing
- How to use 'Summary Functions' as well as mapping data to the dataframe
- being able to sort through data and also combining data to get exactly what we want
